# EncodeBoosting
Code for the paper: 'A Concatenated Approach Based on Transfer Learning and PCA for Classifying Bees and Wasps'
## Descriptions
This repo contains codes for our paper: 'A Concatenated Approach Based on Transfer Learning and PCA for Classifying Bees and Wasps'. Following is the details for each file.
### Encode_boosting
Encode_boosting.ipynb is the training and evaluation process for encode boosting model. You need to get the PCA result before running this code.
### Train_model
Train_model.ipynb is the transfer learning part. Including training and evaluation process for the 4 original models. 
### Evaluate
Evaluate.ipynb is the evaluation process. Metrics used to evaluate the performance were implemented in this file.
### Visualize
Visualize.ipynb is the code for the visualizing of heatmaps. You need trained models to perform this progress.
### Plot_decompose
Plot_decompose.ipynb is the visualizing and PCA part. Results were used in encode_boosting.ipynb.
